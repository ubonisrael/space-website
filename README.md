## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Made further progress in reproducing websites from designs, using flex and grid to produce responsive layouts and accessibility design considerations.

### Continued development

The accessibility design considerations are kind of a new thing to me, hope to improve on them in due time and try and work more on my CSS grid skills.


### Useful resources
